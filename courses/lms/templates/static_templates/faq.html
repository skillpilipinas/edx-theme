    <p>If you don&#39;t find the answer to your questions, <a href="mailto:WWLt2@microsoft.com">contact us</a></p><br>
    <p><b>Q. What do I do if I get an error saying my email address belongs to an existing account when trying to view a course?</b></p>
    <p>This happens when you have already created an account on https://openedx.microsoft.com using your @microsoft.com email address.
To resolve this, please:</p><br>
    <ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Sign-in to the <a href="https://openedx.microsoft.com" target="_blank">https://openedx.microsoft.com</a> site with your @microsoft.com email address.</li>
        <li>Follow the instructions on the "Account update required" page to sign in with or create a Microsoft account. (If you have a hotmail.com, live.com, or outlook.com email address, you already have a Microsoft account.) </li>
        <li>To complete the process, confirm your account update. At this point, you'll be able to sign in to <a href="https://openedx.microsoft.com" target="_blank">https://openedx.microsoft.com</a> site using your Microsoft account.</li>
        <li>You will then be able to register to the <a href="https://courses.microsoft.com" target="_blank">https://courses.microsoft.com</a> site using your AAD credentials.</li>
    </ol>
    <b>Note:</b>Do note that the above mentioned steps will work only if you have learner role and don't have author permissions to sign-in to the CMS. Please contact the customer support team if the solution above does not work for you.<br>

    <b>Q. How will I be notified of courses that are applicable to my role?</b><br>
        <p>All Open edX courses are available on <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/infopedia#/Training">MyLearning</a>, and if a course was developed for your role, you will find it under required or recommended training. You may also receive an email communication about certain campaigns.

</p><br>
    <b>Q. Will I be able to discover open edX courses on Infopedia?</b><br>
        <p>Yes, the Open edX catalog will be available in Infopedia. If courses have not been required or recommended to you on <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/infopedia#/Training">MyLearning</a>, you can locate them in the Infopedia catalog most easily with keyword search. Results improve if you filter on training and add MOOC to your query.  Try these search examples:</p>
    <p><a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/Infopedia/search/pages/results.aspx?term=%22Microsoft%20SharePoint%202016%22%20MOOC&scope=All">"Microsoft SharePoint 2016" MOOC</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/Infopedia/search/pages/results.aspx?term=%22Microsoft%20Exchange%20Server%202016%22%20MOOC&scope=All">"Microsoft Exchange Server 2016" MOOC</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/Infopedia/search/pages/results.aspx?term=%22Microsoft%20Project%22%20MOOC&scope=All">"Microsoft Project" MOOC</a></p>

	<b>Q. What do I do if I am having trouble viewing a video?</b><br>
        <p>The video player will auto-select the best video quality option for your bandwidth. You can try a lower quality option, or you can download the video if that option is available. See screenshot.
